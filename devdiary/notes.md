Golf game

Fore oohhh fore

Wind direction and strength (mph)
Head wind removes 2 yds per 1 mph
Tail wind adds 1 yds per 1 mph
Aim angle
Loft based on club, more when further away
Spin? May make it too complicated. Topspin less loft+more roll, backspin more loft+less roll, left/right sidespin curves left or right
Ball bounce (on fairway grass)
Angle of ball impact maintained, speed drops drastically
Ball spin round outside of hole?
Ball travel speed (slowed by friction) green then fairway, rough, sand, water
Gravity when lofted
Clubhouse for start/end
Slopes? Probably gentle but flat green. Added later
Distance to hole in yards
Auto club selection based on distance, but adjustable
Auto angle based on no wind, but adjustable 
Sand Bunker/Water/Rough hazards
Fairway (between green and tee box)
Green with flag for putting
Strokes and Par
Mulligan - replay a shot dropping a stroke, maybe following water
Drive (from tee)
Caddie follows/carries clubs
Fairway = medium green, Rough = dark green, Green = light green (maybe striped), Sand = buff, Water = blue
Holes get harder as game progresses
Sand normally small, rounded or oval, often near green, in cut outs so balls roll in
Fairway often straight, or slightly angled up to 45’, often lined on both sides by trees
Distant hills
Clouds/Weather
Prevent ball leaving course, trees then bushes

Clubs
-Woods for distance (> 200 yds) - driver from tee, 3 (15-18’ loft) and 5 (20-22’ loft)
-Irons medium (< 200 yds) - 3 to 9 irons (closer = higher number) ~ 10 yds less for each iron number increase, pitching/gap/sand/lob wedge (short approach or hitting ball from rough) ~ 48’ loft
-Putter for one the green (up to 10 yds)

Course selection?
